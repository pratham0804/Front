1. HTML CODE STRUCTURE :-
when we use link tag , to integrate css file to our html page
<link rel="stylesheet" href="buttons.css">
link  tags starts looking around for buttons.css in its own folder , if is unable to find 
it , your css code will not be reflected.

suppose my css file is in another folder (say style)
we use the below tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style/buttons.css">






 
 2. Every visible element on the html web page should be written into  body tag 
    and other elements in head tag
