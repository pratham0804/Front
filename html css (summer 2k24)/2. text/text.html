<!-- Specificity is a concept that sets the priority among selectors
     for ex. :- a class selector is more specific than any normal selector (like p for paragraph)
     so it will have more priority between them.   so order of writing code for styling does not matter , 
     it will always get executed according to its specificity -->



<!--Note:-  Instead of span we  can also use some other inline  tags like strong for bold and u for underline 
             but in this  usecase we  only wanted  the underline visible on hovering , if i had use u tag  for underline
             it will appear below without hovering -->


<!--span is generic , make use  of it whenever u need to style text element-->


<!--If we require some extra spaces between the text elements , 
we use span and set the span margins (left and right).          (This is required as html ignores the extra spaces) -->
